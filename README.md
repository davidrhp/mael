This is a Rust implementation for fly.io's 
distributed systems challenges [Gossip Glomers](https://fly.io/dist-sys/).


## Credits
I started this repo after watching 
Jon Gjengset's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gboGyccRVXI) on the challenge, 
who also implemented a solution in Rust. In particular, he solved 'Echo', 'Unique ID Generation', and 'Broadcast',
located on his [GitHub](https://github.com/jonhoo/rustengan). 

As a result, the first parts of my implementation are very similar, so I wanted to give him credit here.
